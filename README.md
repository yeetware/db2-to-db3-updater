# db2-to-db3-updater
Updates DreamBot 2 source code to DreamBot 3

## Usage
1.) Drop the updater.sh file into your scripts root directory
2.) Run with bash ./updater.sh
3.) Update your scripts imports (I might fix that eventually if someone gives me a list of imports and what they were changed to thnx).
